//! # Day 01: Chronal Calibration
//!
//! [Benchmarking report](../../../day01/target/criterion/report/index.html):
//!
//! * [Part 1](../../../day01/target/criterion/day01_part1/report/index.html)
//! * [Part 2](../../../day01/target/criterion/day01_part2/report/index.html)
//!
//!
//! ## Part One
//!
//! "We've detected some temporal anomalies," one of Santa's Elves at the Temporal
//! Anomaly Research and Detection Instrument Station tells you. She sounded pretty worried
//! when she called you down here. "At 500-year intervals into the past, someone has been
//! changing Santa's history!"
//!
//! "The good news is that the changes won't propagate to our time stream for another 25
//! days, and we have a device" - she attaches something to your wrist - "that will let
//! you fix the changes with no such propagation delay. It's configured to send you 500
//! years further into the past every few days; that was the best we could do on such
//! short notice."
//! "The bad news is that we are detecting roughly _fifty_ anomalies throughout time;
//! the device will indicate fixed anomalies with _stars_. The other bad news is that
//! we only have one device and you're the best person for the job! Good lu--" She taps
//! a button on the device and you suddenly feel like you're falling. To save Christmas,
//! you need to get all _fifty stars_ by December 25th.
//!
//! Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day
//! in the advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first.
//! Each puzzle grants _one star_. Good luck!
//!
//! After feeling like you've been falling for a few minutes, you look at the device's
//! tiny screen. "Error: Device must be calibrated before first use. Frequency drift
//! detected. Cannot maintain destination lock." Below the message, the device shows
//! a sequence of changes in frequency (your puzzle input). A value like `+6` means
//! the current frequency increases by `6`; a value like `-3` means the current
//! frequency decreases by `3`.
//!
//! For example, if the device displays frequency changes of `+1, -2, +3, +1`, then
//! starting from a frequency of zero, the following changes would occur:
//!
//! * Current frequency ` 0`, change of `+1`; resulting frequency ` 1`.
//! * Current frequency ` 1`, change of `-2`; resulting frequency `-1`.
//! * Current frequency `-1`, change of `+3`; resulting frequency ` 2`.
//! * Current frequency ` 2`, change of `+1`; resulting frequency ` 3`.
//!
//! In this example, the resulting frequency is `3`.
//!
//! Here are other example situations:
//!
//! * `+1, +1, +1` results in ` 3`
//! * `+1, +1, -2` results in ` 0`
//! * `-1, -2, -3` results in `-6`
//!
//! Starting with a frequency of zero, _what is the resulting frequency_ after all
//! of the changes in frequency have been applied?
//!
//!
//! ## Part Two
//!
//! You notice that the device repeats the same frequency change list over and over.
//! To calibrate the device, you need to find the first frequency it reaches _twice_.
//!
//! For example, using the same list of changes above, the device would loop as follows:
//!
//! * Current frequency ` 0`, change of `+1`; resulting frequency ` 1`.
//! * Current frequency ` 1`, change of `-2`; resulting frequency `-1`.
//! * Current frequency `-1`, change of `+3`; resulting frequency ` 2`.
//! * Current frequency ` 2`, change of `+1`; resulting frequency ` 3`.
//! * (At this point, the device continues from the start of the list.)
//! * Current frequency ` 3`, change of `+1`; resulting frequency ` 4`.
//! * Current frequency ` 4`, change of `-2`; resulting frequency ` 2`, which has
//! already been seen.
//!
//! In this example, the first frequency reached twice is `2`. Note that your device
//! might need to repeat its list of frequency changes many times before a duplicate
//! frequency is found, and that duplicates might be found while in the middle of
//! processing the list.
//!
//! Here are other examples:
//!
//! * `+1, -1` first reaches `0` twice.
//! * `+3, +3, +4, -2, -4` first reaches `10` twice.
//! * `-6, +3, +8, +5, -6` first reaches `5` twice.
//! * `+7, +7, -2, -7, -4` first reaches `14` twice.
//!
//! _What is the first frequency your device reaches twice?_
